SignalR-QT
==========

This is an C++ implementation of Microsofts ASP.Net SignalR. (https://github.com/SignalR).

The Client Library is finished. Maybe some unit tests will follow. I hope that I get some time to finish the server as well. 

For questions please send me an email (patrik.pfaffenbauer@p3.co.at) or conatct me via skype (patrik.pfaffenbauer)

Client
======

After some long time tests, and stress tests it should be done.


Server
======

Will need some time.
